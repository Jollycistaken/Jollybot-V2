# About

This is a v2 of a bot that I was working on a while back, this bot may have application commands later on 

This bot is still indev, commands are currently being made now due to the help command being finished :)

# Running
1. Install ffmpeg or avconv (I use ffmpeg if you cant decide what to use) and yarn
2. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Jollycistaken/Jollybot-V2`
3. Make a bot on the discord developer panel and enable "Message Content Intent" (its because this bot is based on prefix commands still)
4. Make a .env file and put this inside of it
```
TOKEN="Your token"
PREFIX="the prefix"
OWNER="your discord id"
```
5. Run `npm install -g sodium` (I couldnt get it to install if I used yarn)
6. Run `yarn install`
7. Compile it with `tsc`
