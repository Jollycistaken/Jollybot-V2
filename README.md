# About

This is a v2 of a bot that I was working on a while back, this bot will still not have application commands because I just dislike the look of them

This bot has been remade in typescript because I like typescript more than javascript :)

This bot is still indev, commands are currently being made now due to the help command being finished :)

# Running

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Jollycistaken/Jollybot-V2`
2. Make a .env file and put this inside of it
```
TOKEN="Your token"
PREFIX="the prefix"
```
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Compile it with `tsc`
