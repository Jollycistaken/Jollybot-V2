# About

This is a v2 of a bot that I was working on a while back, this bot will still not have application commands because I just dislike the look of them

This bot has been remade in typescript because I like typescript more then javascript :)

This bot is still indev with no commands made besides a template for the help command

# Running

You can just download the bot, make a .env file and put inside of it

TOKEN="Your token"__
PREFIX="the prefix"

and just compile it with tsc
